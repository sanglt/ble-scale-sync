## BLE Scale Sync

**Best for:**

- Automatic Garmin Connect and Strava sync without a phone
- Home automation integration (MQTT, InfluxDB, webhooks)
- Headless always-on deployment (Raspberry Pi)
- Remote BLE via [ESP32 proxy](/guide/esp32-proxy) when the server has no Bluetooth
- Multi-user households with automatic identification
- Local data logging (CSV/JSONL) alongside cloud exports
- Self-hosting and privacy

## openScale

[openScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale) is an excellent open-source Android app for reading BLE scales with a polished UI.

**Best for:**

- Android users who prefer a phone app
- Users who want a local-first scale tracker on their phone

::: info
Many of BLE Scale Sync's scale adapters were ported from openScale. Others (QN-Scale / FITINDEX, Eufy P2 / P2 Pro, and a few more) were reverse-engineered in this project or ported from dedicated upstream references (e.g. [bdr99/eufylife-ble-client](https://github.com/bdr99/eufylife-ble-client) for the Eufy P2/P2 Pro AES handshake). Both projects benefit from the broader reverse-engineering work by the open-source community.

## openScale-sync

[openScale-sync](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale-sync) is a companion Android app that syncs openScale measurements to external services (Health Connect, Wger, MQTT).

**Best for:**

- openScale users who want Garmin Connect sync via Health Connect
- Android users who want MQTT export without a server

**Limitations:**

- Requires both openScale + openScale-sync installed on Android
- No InfluxDB, webhook, or ntfy support
- Syncs only 4 metrics (weight, body fat, muscle mass, water)

## Manufacturer Apps

Renpho, Yunmai, Xiaomi Mi Fit, and similar apps are the simplest option if you only use one brand.

**Trade-offs:**

- Locked to one brand's ecosystem
- No direct Garmin Connect export (some support Health Connect on Android)
- No MQTT, InfluxDB, or webhook integration
- No headless operation, requires phone for every measurement
- **Your data is stored in their cloud.** Most manufacturer apps upload your weight, body fat, and other health metrics to servers in China or the US. Their privacy policies typically allow sharing data with "partners" or using it for "business purposes", which may include selling aggregated health data to third parties
