# Supported Scales

BLE Scale Sync ships **26 protocol adapters** out of the box, covering Xiaomi, Renpho (incl. FITINDEX, Sencor, QN-Scale), Eufy (incl. P2 Pro T9149), Yunmai, Beurer, Sanitas, Medisana, and more, plus a generic Bluetooth SIG adapter that works with any spec-compliant BCS/WSS scale. Each adapter typically supports several models or rebrands sold under different names, so the real device coverage is much wider than the adapter count. All adapters provide weight + impedance for full [body composition](/body-composition) calculation.

| **Xiaomi** Mi Scale 2 (MIBCS / MIBFS / XMTZC05HM)                     | Passive BLE advertisement decoding (service data 0x181B); no pairing required. Works on all BLE transports (direct, ESPHome proxy, ESP32 MQTT proxy). Uses scale's own body comp values                                                           |
| **Xiaomi** Mijia Body Composition Scale S800 (ms116)                  | Weight via encrypted MiBeacon broadcast (service data 0xFE95); requires a per-device `ble.bind_key` from the Mi cloud.

::: info Sorted by popularity
Most widely available brands are listed first. The Standard BT SIG adapter at the bottom acts as a catch-all for any scale that follows the official Bluetooth Body Composition Service or Weight Scale Service specification.

## Finding Your Scale

The [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) includes interactive scale discovery. It scans for nearby BLE devices, identifies supported scales, and writes the config for you. To scan without the wizard:

```bash
# Docker
docker run --rm --network host --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW \
  ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest scan

# Standalone (Node.js)
npm run scan
```

::: tip Set your scale's MAC address
We recommend setting `scale_mac` in `config.yaml`. It prevents the app from accidentally connecting to a neighbor's scale. The setup wizard does this automatically. If you skip it, the app falls back to auto-discovery by BLE advertisement name.

| **Renpho ES-CS20M / Elis 1** (some hardware variants) | Some units use broadcast-only firmware that does not allow GATT connections. The same model name can ship with different internal hardware. If your ES-CS20M or Elis 1 is broadcast-only, ble-scale-sync reads weight directly from BLE advertisements. Body composition is estimated from BMI (Deurenberg formula) instead of impedance, since impedance is not available in broadcast mode. Run `npm run diagnose` to check whether your unit is connectable or broadcast-only. |

## Don't See Your Scale?

If your scale uses BLE but isn't listed, it might still work. The **Standard BT SIG** adapter catches any scale that follows the official Bluetooth specification. Run the [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) or `npm run scan` to check.
