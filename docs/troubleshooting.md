# Troubleshooting

For general questions that are not about a specific error (supported scales, Garmin 2FA, privacy, multi-user, deployment choices), start with the [FAQ](/faq).

## BLE / Scale Issues

### Scale not found

- **Step on the scale** to wake it up. Most scales go to sleep after a few seconds of inactivity.
- Verify with `npm run scan` (or the Docker `scan` command) that your scale is visible.
- If using `scale_mac`, double-check the address matches the scan output.
- On Linux, make sure Bluetooth is running: `sudo systemctl status bluetooth`

### Connection fails on Raspberry Pi

The app automatically stops BLE discovery before connecting, which resolves most `le-connection-abort-by-local` errors. If connections still fail:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

Then step on the scale and try again.

### Scale was found before but now isn't discovered (Linux)

BlueZ can sometimes stop reporting previously-seen devices. Restart Bluetooth and try again:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### Permission denied (Linux)

Grant BLE capabilities to Node.js:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f $(which node))
```

You need to re-run this after every Node.js update.

### Windows BLE issues

- The default driver (`@abandonware/noble`) works with the native Windows Bluetooth stack, no special setup needed.
- If using `NOBLE_DRIVER=stoprocent`, install the WinUSB driver via [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
- Run your terminal as Administrator if you get permission errors.

### Switching the BLE transport (`ble.handler`)

BLE Scale Sync supports three transport handlers. The default `auto` picks the right local-radio stack per OS. Switch to `mqtt-proxy` or `esphome-proxy` only if you're using a remote BLE radio.

```yaml
ble:
  handler: auto # or: mqtt-proxy, esphome-proxy
```

| Handler         | Use when                                                                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto`          | Default. Local Bluetooth radio on the host (Linux/macOS/Windows).                       |
| `mqtt-proxy`    | Remote ESP32 with custom firmware over MQTT. See [ESP32 BLE Proxy](/guide/esp32-proxy). |
| `esphome-proxy` | Existing ESPHome BT proxy over Native API. See [ESPHome Proxy](/guide/esphome-proxy).   |

### Switching the noble driver (`ble.noble_driver`)

For local-radio mode (`handler: auto`), three OS-specific BLE stacks are available. If connections fail repeatedly, try the alternative driver:

```yaml
ble:
  noble_driver: stoprocent # or: abandonware
```

| Driver                                    | Platforms             | Notes                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `node-ble` (default on Linux)             | Linux only            | Uses BlueZ D-Bus. Most reliable on Raspberry Pi. Service UUIDs not available during scan (only after connecting).  |
| `@abandonware/noble` (default on Windows) | Linux, Windows        | Mature driver. Uses WinRT on Windows.                                                                              |
| `@stoprocent/noble` (default on macOS)    | Linux, macOS, Windows | Newer driver. Exposes service UUIDs during scan. On Windows, requires the [WinUSB driver](https://zadig.akeo.ie/). |

::: tip Note
On Linux, `node-ble` is always used regardless of `noble_driver`. The flag only applies on macOS/Windows or when explicitly set.
:::

If your scale is not being recognized during scan but you know its MAC address, set `scale_mac` in `config.yaml`. The adapter will match post-connect using GATT service UUIDs regardless of the driver.

## Exporter Issues

### Garmin upload fails

- Re-run the [setup wizard](/guide/configuration#setup-wizard-recommended) or `npm run setup-garmin` to refresh tokens.
- Check that your Garmin credentials are correct.
- Garmin may block requests from cloud/VPN IPs. Try authenticating from a different network, then copy `~/.garmin_tokens/` to your target machine.

### MQTT connection hangs or fails

- Make sure you're using the right protocol: `mqtt://` for plain, `mqtts://` for TLS. Using `mqtt://` on a TLS port (8883) will hang.
- Check your broker URL, username, and password.

## Debug Mode

Set `debug: true` in `config.yaml` or use the environment variable to see detailed BLE logs:

```bash
# Docker
docker run ... -e DEBUG=true ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest

# Linux / macOS
DEBUG=true npm start

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:DEBUG="true"; npm start
```

This shows BLE discovery details, advertised services, discovered characteristics, and UUID matching.

## Platform Issues

### Install fails on Raspberry Pi Zero W (first gen)

The original Pi Zero W has an ARMv6 CPU, which is **not supported**. The `esbuild` binary (used by the TypeScript runner `tsx`) requires ARMv7 or later and will crash with `SIGILL` (illegal instruction) on ARMv6. This affects both native installs and Docker.

**Solution:** Use a [Raspberry Pi Zero 2W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) (~15€, ARMv7/64-bit) or any Pi 3/4/5.

## Docker Issues

### Container can't find BLE adapter

Make sure you're passing all required flags. See [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started#docker) for the full command. The most common mistake is forgetting `--network host` or the D-Bus volume mount.

### Wrong Bluetooth group GID

The `--group-add` value must match your system's Bluetooth group. Find it with:

```bash
getent group bluetooth | cut -d: -f3
```

Common values: `112` (Debian/Ubuntu), `108` (Arch).

### BLE discovery stops working after hours (BlueZ stuck state)

**Symptoms** (visible with `DEBUG=true`):

- Repeated `startDiscovery failed: Discovery already in progress` and `D-Bus StopDiscovery failed: No discovery started`
- Or `Discovery started` logs succeed, but the scale is never found even after stepping on it
- Common on Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / Zero 2W with the on-board Broadcom adapter under continuous-mode load

**Cause.** A [known BlueZ bug](https://github.com/bluez/bluez/issues/807) (also tracked at [bluez/bluer#47](https://github.com/bluez/bluer/issues/47)): after repeated GATT connect/disconnect cycles, BlueZ's `Discovering` property desyncs from the HCI controller. The daemon reports active discovery, but the controller is no longer running LE scan.

::: warning Hardware/firmware limitation, not just software
On Pi 3/4 Broadcom on-board chips, this is a kernel/firmware-level issue that even much larger projects have given up on fixing in software. See [home-assistant/operating-system#4022](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/issues/4022) and [home-assistant/core#142656](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/142656), both closed as **Not Planned** with HA recommending a Bluetooth proxy as the workaround. The recovery tiers below clear the wedge on most setups but not all of them.
:::

**Recommended long-term fix: Bluetooth proxy.** The most reliable way to run BLE Scale Sync on a Pi long-term is to bypass the on-board Bluetooth entirely. Run an external [ESP32 BLE proxy](/guide/esp32-proxy) (≈€8 board, communicates over MQTT) or reuse an existing [ESPHome BT proxy](/guide/esphome-proxy). Both eliminate the host BlueZ stack from the BLE path completely.

**Automatic in-process recovery.** The app already:

- Resets its D-Bus client after every GATT operation in continuous mode
- Runs a preemptive `btmgmt power off/on` cycle after every GATT operation to clear zombie controller state before it accumulates
- Escalates through 6 recovery tiers when `StartDiscovery` fails (D-Bus `StopDiscovery`, adapter power-cycle, btmgmt reset, rfkill block/unblock, `systemctl restart bluetooth`)

**Auto-restart watchdog (continuous mode).** When in-process recovery is not enough (typically Pi 3/4 Broadcom firmware lock-up), a watchdog exits the process after `runtime.watchdog_max_consecutive_failures` consecutive scan failures (default `10`, ≈30 min). With Docker `restart: unless-stopped` the container restarts cleanly, the entrypoint resets the BT adapter, and the controller is typically unwedged. The watchdog only arms after the first successful weigh-in in the process lifetime, so it does not restart-loop the container if the scale is offline (vacation) or `scale_mac` is misconfigured.

The watchdog counts only cycles where the Bluetooth radio looks unhealthy: a connection or read failure, or a scan that saw no advertisement traffic at all (the zombie-discovery wedge). A normal idle cycle, where the radio still hears other nearby devices but your scale simply is not being stood on, does not count toward a restart. This is why a scale that only advertises while in use (such as Renpho) no longer triggers needless restarts overnight.

::: warning The watchdog recovers by **exiting the process** — set a restart policy
The recovery is the process _exiting_ so the supervisor starts it again. You **must** run with `restart: unless-stopped` (Compose) or `--restart unless-stopped` (`docker run`). Without a restart policy the container just stops.

A Docker/Compose `restart:` policy fires only on process **exit** — it does **not** act on the `HEALTHCHECK` going `unhealthy`. If you see the container stuck `Up (unhealthy)` but never restarting, plain Docker is working as designed: only Swarm, Kubernetes, or an [autoheal](https://github.com/willfarrell/docker-autoheal) sidecar restarts on health status. With a restart policy and the hard-exit floor below, the process always exits, so the policy always fires.
:::

To bound the rare case where a wedged D-Bus/BlueZ handle pins the event loop open and graceful shutdown cannot drain (the process logs `Stopped.` but never exits, so the restart policy never fires), the app force-exits 5s after any abort-driven shutdown. Override with `BLE_HARD_EXIT_GRACE_MS` (1000–60000 ms) if your cleanup legitimately needs longer.

```yaml
runtime:
  watchdog_max_consecutive_failures: 10 # default; 0 = disabled
```

```bash
# Or env override
docker run ... -e BLE_WATCHDOG_MAX_FAILURES=10 ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest
```

**Docker compose tip.** Make sure `/dev/rfkill` is mapped so Tier 5 recovery is available:

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/rfkill:/dev/rfkill
```

**Systemd watchdog (Type=notify).** Defense in depth for the rare case where a synchronous D-Bus stall freezes the Node event loop entirely. When that happens the in-process watchdog cannot fire either, since `setTimeout` callbacks never run. Letting systemd do the liveness check from outside the process is the clean fix.

::: warning Scope of this watchdog
Only catches **whole-loop freezes**. If the event loop is alive but a specific BLE handler is wedged (e.g. an `await` that never resolves), the heartbeat keeps firing and systemd is satisfied. For BLE-specific recovery, rely on `runtime.watchdog_max_consecutive_failures` and the consecutive-failure watchdog above.
:::

Add the following to your `ble-scale.service` unit on the Pi (or any systemd host):

```
[Service]
Type=notify
WatchdogSec=60
NotifyAccess=main
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
```

The app sends `READY=1` once at startup and `WATCHDOG=1` every `WatchdogSec / 2` seconds. If the heartbeat misses for `WatchdogSec`, systemd kills and restarts the unit. The integration is a no-op when `$NOTIFY_SOCKET` is unset (Docker, `npm start`, non-systemd installs), so the same binary works everywhere.

**Last-resort escape hatch: switch away from BlueZ.** If BlueZ keeps getting stuck despite the above, bypass it entirely by using the `@stoprocent/noble` driver (HCI socket directly, no D-Bus):

```yaml
ble:
  noble_driver: stoprocent
```

Or set `NOBLE_DRIVER=stoprocent` as an environment variable. Trade-off: the app takes exclusive HCI access, so you cannot run `bluetoothctl`, Home Assistant's Bluetooth integration, or any other BLE consumer on the same adapter at the same time.

On the host you can also verify BlueZ state manually:

```bash
bluetoothctl show | grep Discovering
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth   # manual recovery
```
