 * BLE handler backed by `@abandonware/noble` (Windows default; mature driver).
 * Shared logic lives in handler-noble-shared.ts (#181).
 *
 * `@abandonware/noble`'s `get state()` accessor triggers `bindings.init()` as a
 * side effect on first read, so read the raw `._state` field instead to preserve
 * the original init behaviour. The `_state` field is not in the package typings,
 * hence the cast.
