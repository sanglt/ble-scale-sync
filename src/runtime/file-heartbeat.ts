/**
 * Liveness heartbeat file consumed by the Docker HEALTHCHECK (#277).
 *
 * The check asks one question: is this process still alive? It answers it by
 * requiring the file's mtime to be within 5 minutes. That only works if the
 * file is touched on a timer.
 *
 * It used to be touched once per `runContinuousLoop` iteration, and the
 * iteration then blocks in `source.nextReading()`. On the proxy transports that
 * blocks until somebody stands on the scale, so the file was really a
 * "last reading" marker being read as a "process is alive" marker. Any idle
 * period over 5 minutes flipped the container to unhealthy. On plain Docker
 * that is inert, but the Home Assistant Supervisor watchdog restarts an add-on
 * whose container reports unhealthy, which turned normal idle into a permanent
 * restart loop.
 *
 * Scope, matching the systemd watchdog's contract: this catches whole-loop
 * freezes only. A frozen event loop (the synchronous D-Bus stall in #140)
 * cannot run this interval callback either, so the file goes stale exactly when
 * it should. If the event loop is alive but a specific BLE handler is wedged,
 * the heartbeat keeps ticking; that case belongs to
 * `runtime.watchdog_max_consecutive_failures` and the hard-exit floor.
