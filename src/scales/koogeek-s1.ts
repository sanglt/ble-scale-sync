/**
 * Adapter for the Koogeek-S1 body-composition scale (issue #270).
 *
 * The protocol was reverse-engineered from the vendor's Smart Health app and
 * validated against real hardware by the reporter:
 *
 *   - Vendor service 0xFFF0, notify 0xFFF4, write 0xFFF3.
 *   - Frames are `55 AA 55 AA <cmd> [<0x01> outbound] <payload...> <XOR>`,
 *     where the trailing byte is the XOR of every preceding byte.
 *   - Once notifications are enabled the scale repeats a command 0x01 init
 *     frame and streams no weight at all until the client answers it with the
 *     command 0x81 acknowledgement. A command 0x07 query must be answered with
 *     command 0x87 echoing data[6]. Both replies are per-frame, so they live in
 *     buildAck and no onConnected handshake is needed.
 *   - Data frames are 14 bytes: command 0x02 is a live reading, 0x03 is the
 *     stable one. Weight is data[9..10] big endian tenths of a kg, impedance is
 *     data[11..12] big endian ohms.
 *
 * The vendor computed body composition in a cloud service that no longer
 * exists, so metrics come from the project's generic BIA path.
 *
 * Known limitation: this hardware's GATT connect and service discovery are
 * unreliable on BlueZ and on ESP32 NimBLE, and connect only occasionally on
 * macOS CoreBluetooth. That is a link-layer trait of the device, not something
 * an adapter can influence.
