 * Shared advertisement fingerprint for Lefu OEM stock units sold as the Hutbit

 *
 * This lives in its own module rather than in `hutbit.ts` because both the
 * Hutbit adapter (to claim the unit) and the Robi S9 adapter (to bow out of it)
 * need the exact same predicate, and adapters do not import each other. The
 * established alternatives were both worse: inlining the constant twice
 * (as `mi-scale-2.ts` does with Beurer's company id) lets the two copies drift
 * apart, and drift here is a live-device false-match rather than a cosmetic bug.
 *
 * Both callers MUST use this one predicate. An asymmetric pair, where Robi bows
 * out of a wider set than the Hutbit claims, would strand a device between the
 * two: rejected by Robi, unclaimed by Hutbit, and swept up by MGB on the bare
 * FFB0 service, whose parser rejects every frame this family sends.

 * 7 bytes ending in a status byte (0x00 idle / 0x01 active), advertised
 * alongside both the FFB0 and D618 services.
 *
 * The 7-byte payload is the device's own MAC reversed plus that status byte
 * (nRF capture in #278: `7EB893ECB303|01` for MAC 03:B3:EC:93:B8:7E). Only the
 * shape is checked, not the MAC itself: `BleDeviceInfo` carries no address
 * field, and a MAC check would not disambiguate anyway, since every device in
 * this family reverses its own MAC.
 *
 * Why an advertisement fingerprint at all: the branded unit advertises
 * "Hutbit Scale", but Lefu OEM stock advertises "SWAN", and over the ESPHome
 * proxy the local name arrives empty because it lives in the scan response.
 * The manufacturer data and service list ride in the advertisement proper, so
 * they survive every transport that populates `manufacturerData`.
