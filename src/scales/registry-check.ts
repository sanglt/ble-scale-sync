 * Structural integrity checks for the scale-adapter registry.
 *
 * These run at startup and do NOT need BLE fixtures — they assert the
 * invariants the registry array relies on for correct precedence:
 *
 *  - adapter names are unique (the name is used in logs and as the stable
 *    identifier in collision diagnostics);
 *  - the generic {@link StandardGattScaleAdapter} fallback is positioned last,
 *    so it never shadows a specific adapter via its broad BCS/WSS match.
 *
 * The fixture-based collision guard (one representative {@link
 * '../interfaces/scale-adapter.js'.BleDeviceInfo} per adapter, verifying
 * `adapters.find(matches)` resolves to the right adapter) lives in the test
 * suite — it needs a fixture corpus that is test data, not shipped code.
