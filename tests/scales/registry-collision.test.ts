/**
 * Registry collision guard for #182.
 *
 * Production resolves a scale with `adapters.find(a => a.matches(info))`
 * (uniformly across handler-noble*, handler-mqtt-proxy/*,
 * handler-esphome-proxy/*). Precedence (registry array order) is the ONLY
 * thing stopping a broad `matches()` from shadowing a more specific adapter —
 * the root cause of #168 (BF720↔Mi Scale 2), #177 (T9146↔Inlife), #135 (Lefu).
 *
 * This test pins one representative advertisement per registered adapter and
 * asserts the FIRST matching adapter (i.e. what production picks) is the
 * intended one. It fails the moment a new or widened `matches()` shadows an
 * existing adapter, and names every colliding adapter so the offender is
 * obvious. Each fixture mirrors that adapter's own per-adapter test (incl.
 * post-discovery `characteristicUuids` for the 0xFFF0 / 0x181B families).
 *
 * NOTE: strict mutual exclusion is intentionally NOT asserted —
 * `StandardGattScaleAdapter` is a deliberately broad BCS/WSS fallback that
 * overlaps many specific adapters by design; precedence (it is last) is the
 * mechanism. First-match correctness is the real invariant.
